1. **Spoofed Email Address** – The sender domain has no relation to Coca-Cola.
2. **No Personalization** – Message uses generic language to target anyone.
3. **Unrealistic Offer** – "Win a Blender for Free!" is bait for personal data.
4. **Urgent CTA** – "Get Started Now!" button increases pressure to act.
5. **Suspicious Domain** – Actual link leads to an insecure non-Coca-Cola domain.
6. **Social Engineering** – Uses excitement and urgency to manipulate the reader.
