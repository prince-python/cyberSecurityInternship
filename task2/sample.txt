⚠️ Red Flags Identified:
1. Sender's email address is suspicious and unrelated to Coca-Cola.
2. No recipient personalization (e.g., “Dear Prince” missing).
3. Urgent language — designed to create FOMO or panic clicking.
4. High reward for no reason — typical phishing trick.
5. External domain doesn't belong to official Coca-Cola channels.
6. Use of images and flashy CTA buttons to distract from the scam.

Conclusion: This is a typical giveaway scam email using branding, fake urgency, and spoofed sender info to collect personal data.
