# cyberSecurityInternship
Daily cybersecurity internship tasks including port scanning, phishing analysis, and network security research.
This repository contains all tasks completed during my Cyber Security Internship at Elevate Labs, in collaboration with Skill India and the Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India.

Each task focuses on building hands-on skills in network security, threat detection, ethical hacking, and real-world reconnaissance using tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and email header analyzers.

📁 Tasks are organized in separate folders (task1, task2, ...) and include:

Scanning local networks for open ports

Identifying phishing emails and spoofed senders

Analyzing social engineering techniques

And more upcoming security exercises

🚀 The goal is to apply core cybersecurity concepts practically and document findings with clear reports and screenshots.
