## 🔍 Key Learnings:

- **What is a VPN?**  
  A Virtual Private Network encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP address to protect privacy.

- **VPN vs Proxy:**  
  VPN encrypts full traffic, proxy only masks IP without encryption.

- **VPN Protocols:**  
  ProtonVPN uses **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard** — secure & fast.

- **Limitations:**  
  Free VPNs have slower speeds, fewer servers, and don’t guarantee full anonymity.
